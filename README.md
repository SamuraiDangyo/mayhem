## Overview
Mayhem NNUE is Sapeli written in C++14 using SF NNUE evaluation.
Mayhem NNUE requires an EvalFile to properly evaluate.
`make` should build a good binary. If not then remove flags until it does.
`Hash` UCI option should be at least 256MB. Because NNUE evaluation is slow. Used for sorting too.
Happy hacking!
